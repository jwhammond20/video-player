# Video Player

This is a custom video player solution I built to integrate a single playlist and display a responsive video player on our website. The video player was built using the YouTube API and includes a custom playlist and main video player. When a playlist item is selected, the video player will simultaneously change to display the selected video.

## Features

- Custom video player built with JavaScript and CSS.
- YouTube API integration to display a single playlist.
- Responsive design to display properly on multiple devices.
- Custom playlist with the ability to select videos and display them in the main video player.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Use the playlist to select a video to play in the main video player.
4. Enjoy the video!
